2) The path cannot move diagonally. It can only move up, down, left, and right.
3) The tiles may be visited more than once.
4) The path must start at the bottom row.
5) The maze is completed once the line reaches the top row.
6) All mazes will be in the shape of a square
7) The first line of text for every maze is the legend
